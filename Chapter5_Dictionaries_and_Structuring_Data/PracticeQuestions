1. d = {}

2. d = {'foo': 42}

3. list is indexed by integer values. A dictionary can be indexed by any data type

4. An error is thrown unless you are assigning a new key-value pair

5. cat in spam will look for either a key or value that is 'cat'. cat in spam.keys() looks at all keys specifically

6. Same as 5, but cat in spam.value looks at all values of the dictionary and nested dictionaries

7. spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

8. pprint from pprint

1. two curly braces: {}

2. {'foo': 42}

3. The items stored i a dictionary are unordered, while items in a list are ordered

4. You get a KeyError error

5. No difference. The in operator checks whether a value exists as a key in the dictionary

6. 'cat' in spam checks whether there is a 'cat' key in the dictionary, while 'cat' in spam.values() checks whether there is a value 'cat' for one of the keys in spam

7. spam.setdefault('color', 'black')

8. pprint.pprint()

5.
